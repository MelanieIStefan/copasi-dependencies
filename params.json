{"name":"Copasi-dependencies","tagline":"Collection of open source libraries to simplify COPASI builds","body":"# COPASI Dependencies\r\nThis project contains a number of open source libraries, that make the building of [COPASI](http://copasi.org \"COPASI\") with [CMAKE](http://www.cmake.org/) as easy as to configure with: \r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake -DCOPASI_DEPENDENCY_DIR=<dir> <copasi source dir>  \r\nmake  \r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Building the dependencies\r\nFor the time being, I am using shell scripts for the individual operating systems to create the build. All of them install into the `./bin` directory of the project. From there I usually either archive, rename, or refer to it directly from CMAKE. \r\n\r\nWhen building the dependencies, you have only to be aware of one thing. The scripts are pretty much dumb, and just build whatever they can, and they certainly won't worry whether the build was successful. So if you happen to not have Qt present, then building all the Qt dependencies will pretty much fail (those being the MML widget, QWT and QWT3dPlot). Now that will be fine, if all you want to build is the language bindings / CopasiSE, but might not be otherwise. \r\n\r\nShould the build fail unexpectedly for any other reason, please feel free to file an issue and let me know!\r\n### Windows\r\nTruth be told, building the dependencies on windows was the hardest, and so there is a while bunch of batch scripts for the case. There are ones for debug builds and release builds. And while they have directories hard coded in them that suit me, those directories might not exist on your machine. But don't despair, you can override them easily. The environment variables to watch out for: \r\n\r\n- `INCLUDE`: if not set variants of vcvars will be called to set up MSVC\r\n- `QTDIR`: if not set my Qt directories will be used, otherwise just set to your Qt root\r\n- `QMAKESPEC`: set to win32-msvc2010 by default\r\n\r\nThe batch files so far: \r\n\r\n```\r\ncreateX64.bat  \r\ncreateX64-vs10.bat\r\ncreateX86-vs10.bat  \r\ncreateX86_vs11_x64_debug.bat  \r\ncreateX86_vs11_x64_release.bat  \r\ncreateX86_vs11_x86_debug.bat  \r\ncreateX86_vs11_x86_release.bat  \r\n```\r\n\r\n### OS X\r\nOn OSX the `QTDIR` amd and `QMAKESPEC` (to `macx-g++`) are hardcoded to my location. Since I use Lion / Mountainlion, I build with universal binaries for `i386` and `x86_64`, if that is not sufficient, you might need to adapt the: \r\n\r\n```\r\n./createOSX.sh\r\n```\r\n \r\n### Linux\r\nTo build the dependencies on Linux, be sure to have your operating systems qt4 libraries installed (if building with GUI) there I don't even begin to set the `QMAKESPEC` ot `QTDIR` as I hope for qmake to be readily available. To build simply run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./createLinux.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Resetting the build\r\nSimly remove the `bin` and `tmp` folder to start over. \r\n\r\n```\r\nrm -rf bin  \r\nrm -rf tmp  \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\nThe following open source libraries are included in this project: \r\n\r\n- [clapack 3.2.1](http://www.netlib.org/clapack/)\r\n- [cppunit 1.12.1](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/)\r\n- [expat 2.1.0](http://expat.sourceforge.net/)\r\n- Qt MML widget (LGPL, Qt Solutions)\r\n- [QWT 5.2.0](http://qwt.sourceforge.net/)\r\n- [QWT 3D plot](http://qwtplot3d.sourceforge.net/)\r\n- [libSBML 5.8.0](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML)\r\n- [SBW Core](http://sbw.sourceforge.net/)\r\n- [raptor](http://librdf.org/raptor/)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nJust in case it needs saying, each of the libraries in the `src` folder are released under their own respective licenses.
